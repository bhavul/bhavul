### Hi there 👋

I'm Bhavul. I am a Data Scientist, working with Zapr and driving key NLP and Recommendation Systems project. I enjoy building products that can solve some real probems and have a strong impact on people's lives. I have a keen interest in ML research and am working on some research ideas myself in NLP domain. The dream is to be one of the biggest contributors to the field and help generate an enormous impact on the entire world through AI.  

✨ Open for full-time opportunities in ML domain, preferably ones that involve some aspect of research too  
👐 Open for Collaboration on research or any interesting projects  
🔥 Happy to speak at meetups, tech-confs for knowledge sharing  

On the non-tech side of things, I enjoy all kinds of artforms. I especially love poetry, and stand-up comedy. I have an incredibly diverse taste in music. I enjoy meditation and am trying to get more and more away from social networks, to seize every single hour of every single day.  

Carpe Diem.
