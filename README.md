### Hi there 👋

I'm an Applied ML Researcher/Engineer currently working for Meta (Facebook) where I am building foundational models to understand users and videos that help get you better recommendations on FB Watch, and IG Reels. Previously I worked as a Research Scientist (ML/AI) at [Zapr](https://www.zapr.in) driving their key NLP and Recommendation Systems projects. 

I have a keen interest in ML research, and I also enjoy building products and try to maintain full stack knowledge. I'm an advocate for Open Source and "AI for Good". Also, I am...

👋 Open for opportunities in ML domain  
👐 Open for collaboration on projects  
😊 Happy to speak at meetups or tech conferences  

I'm open to new job opportunities, freelance or consulting work, collaborations for research, side projects, or new ideas. I can also coach for cracking FAANG tech interviews. Feel free to reach out to me.
